Rule:
Every time a minor or major change is made to any project-related code, configuration, or documentation, the corresponding Cursor document must be updated immediately with a brief summary of the change.

Purpose:
	•	To maintain an accurate and continuous record of the project’s evolution
	•	To ensure clarity and accountability, even when working alone
	•	To make it easier to backtrack, debug, or explain decisions later on

Guidelines:
	•	Use timestamps and bullet points for clarity
	•	Include code snippet references if applicable
	•	Keep the change logs short but descriptive (e.g., “Updated form validation on InventoryForm.tsx to include date picker”)
	•	If the change is experimental or uncertain, note it clearly (e.g., “Testing alternate Supabase query on line 42”)
