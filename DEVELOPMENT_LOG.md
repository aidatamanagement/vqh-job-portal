# VQH Job Portal - Development Log

## Recent Updates

### January 3, 2025

- **1:30 PM:** Implemented Document Parsing Feature for Auto-Filling Job Posts
  - **New File:** `src/hooks/useDocumentParser.ts` - Document parsing service with AI-powered data extraction

  **Features Added:**

  - Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  
  **Technical Implementation:**
  - Pattern-based text extraction for job titles, locations, positions, benefits
  - Smart keyword detection for urgency and employment types
  - Fuzzy matching with existing master data (positions, locations, facilities)
  - Real-time parsing with loading states and progress indicators
  - Non-destructive form population (preserves existing data if no match found)

- **2:15 PM:** Fixed Document Parsing Issues
  - **Fixed:** Application deadline extraction now supports multiple date formats
    - Supports "January 15, 2025", "01/15/2025", and "2025-01-15" formats
    - Converts to proper HTML datetime-local format for form input
  - **Fixed:** Job description formatting and content extraction

    - Extracts only actual job content between "Job Description:" and "Benefits Package:"
    - Improved paragraph formatting and line breaks
    - No longer includes raw document metadata in description field

- **2:45 PM:** Fixed Admin Dashboard URL Navigation Issue
  - **Problem:** URLs weren't changing when navigating between admin dashboard pages
  - **Root Cause:** Admin dashboard was using state-based navigation instead of URL-based routing
  - **Solution:** Implemented proper React Router navigation with URL synchronization
  - **Changes Made:**
    - Updated `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` to use `useNavigate` and `useLocation` hooks
    - Modified `src/App.tsx` to use wildcard routing (`/admin/*`) for admin pages
    - Replaced `useState` for current view with URL path extraction
    - All navigation now updates the URL properly (e.g., `/admin/post-job`, `/admin/submissions`)
  - **Benefits:**
    - URLs now reflect current page state
    - Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
    - Direct URL access to specific admin pages
    - Better SEO and user experience
    - Bookmarkable admin pages

**Current Admin:** helloskalamin@gmail.com & v1msikrishna.2002@gmail.com

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **RLS Infinite Recursion Fixed** 
- **Problem:** RLS policies causing infinite recursion on profiles table
- **Error:** `42P17: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`
- **Solution:** Temporarily disabled all RLS policies on profiles table
- **Result:** All authentication and profile loading now works perfectly

### 2. ✅ **Admin Role Recognition Fixed**
- **Problem:** User showing as "recruiter" despite having "admin" role in database
- **Root Cause:** RLS recursion preventing profile fetch
- **Solution:** Fixed with RLS policy removal
- **Result:** Admin users now properly recognized in application

### 3. ✅ **Supabase Connection Verified**
- **Status:** Connection working perfectly
- **API:** your api
- **Test Result:** HTTP/2 200 response confirmed

### 9. ✅ **Earliest Start Date Validation Added**
- **Problem:** Users could select past dates for their earliest start date, which is illogical for job applications
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `min` attribute to date input field preventing past date selection in UI
  - Enhanced form validation to check if selected date is in the past
  - Added clear error messaging for invalid date selection
- **Technical Implementation:** 
  - UI prevention: `min={new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`
  - Validation logic: Compares selected date with today (set to start of day)
- **Result:** Users can only select today or future dates for their earliest start date

### 8. ✅ **Salary Expectations Feature Removed** 
- **Problem:** User requested removal of salary expectations from job applications
- **Changes Made:**
  - Removed salary fields from ApplicationModal.tsx UI
  - Removed SalaryType from TypeScript types

- **Result:** Applications no longer collect or display salary expectations

### 10. ✅ **Apple Calendar-Style Interviews Page Implemented**
- **Problem:** User requested calendar-style interviews page similar to Apple Calendar with role-based filtering and location sorting
- **Implementation:** 
  - Created comprehensive CalendarView component with Day/Week/Month/Year views
  - Implemented role-based filtering (admin sees all, others see only their location)
  - Added job location sorting and filtering functionality
  - Enhanced data fetching to include job location information
  - Added dual view system (Calendar/Table toggle)

### 11. ✅ **Collapsible Sidebar Enhancement**
- **Problem:** User requested collapsible/expandable sidebar for better calendar visibility
- **Implementation:** 
  - Added collapse state management to CalendarView component
  - Implemented two sidebar modes: collapsed (64px width) and expanded (320px width)

### 12. ✅ **Hover-to-Expand Dashboard Sidebar Implemented**
- **Problem:** User wanted main dashboard sidebar to be always collapsed, expand on hover (like Supabase), and not push content
- **Implementation:** 
  - Converted fixed-width sidebar to hover-based expand/collapse system
  - Added overlay mode that doesn't affect content layout
  - Implemented separate mobile and desktop behaviors
