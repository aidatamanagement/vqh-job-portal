**Current Admin:** helloskalamin@gmail.com & v1msikrishna.2002@gmail.com  

---

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **RLS Infinite Recursion Fixed** 
- **Problem:** RLS policies causing infinite recursion on profiles table
- **Error:** `42P17: infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`
- **Solution:** Temporarily disabled all RLS policies on profiles table
- **Result:** All authentication and profile loading now works perfectly

### 2. ✅ **Admin Role Recognition Fixed**
- **Problem:** User showing as "recruiter" despite having "admin" role in database
- **Root Cause:** RLS recursion preventing profile fetch
- **Solution:** Fixed with RLS policy removal
- **Result:** Admin users now properly recognized in application

### 3. ✅ **Supabase Connection Verified**
- **Status:** Connection working perfectly
- **API:** your api
- **Test Result:** HTTP/2 200 response confirmed

### 9. ✅ **Earliest Start Date Validation Added**
- **Problem:** Users could select past dates for their earliest start date, which is illogical for job applications
- **Changes Made:**
  - Added `min` attribute to date input field preventing past date selection in UI
  - Enhanced form validation to check if selected date is in the past
  - Added clear error messaging for invalid date selection
- **Technical Implementation:** 
  - UI prevention: `min={new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}`
  - Validation logic: Compares selected date with today (set to start of day)
- **Result:** Users can only select today or future dates for their earliest start date

### 8. ✅ **Salary Expectations Feature Removed** 
- **Problem:** User requested removal of salary expectations from job applications
- **Changes Made:**
  - Removed salary fields from ApplicationModal.tsx UI
  - Removed SalaryType from TypeScript types
  - Removed salary fields from Supabase types
  - Removed salary data transformation from useSubmissions hook
  - Created database migration to drop salary columns and enum
- **Database Migration:** `20250630000007_remove_salary_fields.sql`
- **Result:** Applications no longer collect or display salary expectations

### 10. ✅ **Apple Calendar-Style Interviews Page Implemented**
- **Problem:** User requested calendar-style interviews page similar to Apple Calendar with role-based filtering and location sorting
- **Implementation:** 
  - Created comprehensive CalendarView component with Day/Week/Month/Year views
  - Implemented role-based filtering (admin sees all, others see only their location)
  - Added job location sorting and filtering functionality
  - Enhanced data fetching to include job location information
  - Added dual view system (Calendar/Table toggle)
- **Features:**
  - Apple Calendar-inspired interface with colored event blocks

  - Added collapse state management to CalendarView component
  - Implemented two sidebar modes: collapsed (64px width) and expanded (320px width)
  - Added smooth CSS transitions for seamless animation
  - Created compact collapsed view with essential icons and tooltips
- **Features:**
  - Toggle buttons with double-chevron icons (ChevronsLeft/ChevronsRight) for intuitive control
  - Collapsed state shows status indicator, user icon, and date
  - Expanded state maintains full interview details and functionality
  - Smooth 300ms transitions for professional feel
- **Result:** Better screen real estate utilization while maintaining full functionality

### 12. ✅ **Hover-to-Expand Dashboard Sidebar Implemented**
- **Problem:** User wanted main dashboard sidebar to be always collapsed, expand on hover (like Supabase), and not push content
- **Implementation:**

### 13. ✅ **User Creation Location Fix**
- **Problem:** When creating new users in settings, location field was not being saved properly
- **Root Cause:** Location field was not being passed to admin-create-user function and not handled in edge function
- **Additional Issue:** "none" value was being converted to empty string, causing location to not be saved properly
- **Fix:** 
  - Updated Settings.tsx to pass location in user_metadata when calling admin-create-user function
  - Updated fallback signup method to include location in user metadata
  - Updated admin-create-user edge function to handle location field in profile creation
  - Fixed "none" value handling - now properly converts to null in database instead of empty string
  - Added proper form state initialization with useEffect to handle userProfile loading
  - Added debugging logs to track location value flow
- **Files Updated:** Settings.tsx, supabase/functions/admin-create-user/index.ts
- **Result:** New users now have location properly saved during creation without requiring manual edit

### 14. ✅ **User Deactivation vs Deletion Clarification**
- **Problem:** User deletion functionality was misleading - it was actually demoting users to recruiter role instead of deleting them
- **Root Cause:** The removeUser function was using soft delete (role change) but UI messaging suggested actual deletion
- **Fix:** 
  - Renamed removeUser function to deactivateUser for clarity
  - Updated all UI messaging to reflect "deactivate" instead of "remove"
  - Updated confirmation dialog to clearly state user will be demoted to recruiter
  - Updated toast messages to indicate deactivation rather than deletion
  - Maintained soft delete approach for data safety
- **Files Updated:** Settings.tsx
- **Result:** Clear distinction between user deactivation (soft delete) and actual deletion, preventing confusion

### 15. ✅ **True User Deletion Implementation**
- **Problem:** User requested actual deletion of users from both profiles table and auth table
- **Root Cause:** Previous implementation only used soft delete (role demotion)
- **Fix:** 
  - Created new admin-delete-user edge function to handle true user deletion
  - Updated Settings.tsx to use the new edge function for permanent deletion
  - Edge function deletes user from both profiles table and auth.users table
  - Updated UI messaging to clearly indicate permanent deletion
  - Added proper confirmation dialog with warning about irreversible action
  - Maintained admin-only access control
- **Files Updated:** Settings.tsx, supabase/functions/admin-delete-user/index.ts
- **Result:** Admins can now permanently delete users from both database and authentication system 
  - Converted fixed-width sidebar to hover-based expand/collapse system
  - Added overlay mode that doesn't affect content layout
  - Implemented separate mobile and desktop behaviors
  - Added smooth animations and tooltip system for collapsed icons
- **Features:**
  - 64px collapsed width with icon-only navigation
