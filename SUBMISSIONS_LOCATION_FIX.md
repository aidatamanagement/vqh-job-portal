# Submissions Location Display Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Clearer Location Labels**
- **Updated table header** from "Location" to "Job Location" for clarity
- **Updated filter dropdown** from "All Locations" to "All Job Locations" 
- Makes it clear this is the job's location, not the applicant's location

### 2. **Current Database Schema Compatibility**
- Currently works with your existing database schema (`jobs.location`)
- Submissions page will show the job location from the `location` field in jobs table
- No 400 errors - uses only existing columns

### 3. **Data Mapping**
The submissions currently show:
- **Job Location**: From `jobs.location` field (your current schema)
- **Applied Position**: From `applied_position` field (added by database fix)
- **Candidate Location**: From `city_state` field in applications

## Files Modified

1. **`src/components/admin/components/SubmissionsTable.tsx`**
   - Changed table header from "Location" to "Job Location"

2. **`src/components/admin/components/SubmissionsFilters.tsx`**
   - Updated filter dropdown from "All Locations" to "All Job Locations"

3. **`src/components/admin/hooks/useSubmissions.ts`**
   - Verified to use current database schema (jobs.location)

## Current Behavior

### âœ… **What Works Now:**
- Submissions page loads without errors
- Shows job location from the jobs.location field
- Location filtering works properly
- Clear labels distinguish job location from candidate location

### ðŸ”„ **Future Ready:**
When you eventually apply the office/work location migration:
- Can be easily updated to show `office_location` 
- Filter can be enhanced to filter by office location
- Table can be expanded to show both office and work locations

## Display Example

| Candidate | Position | Applied Date | **Job Location** | Manager | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| John Doe | Nurse | 2025-01-03 | **Dallas, TX** | Jane Smith | Under Review |

The **Job Location** column now clearly shows where the job is located (from your jobs table), making it distinct from where the candidate is located.

## Optional Future Enhancement

If you want to show both job location and candidate location:

```tsx
// Future enhancement - show both locations
<TableCell className="min-w-[140px]">
  <div className="text-sm">
    <div className="text-gray-900">Job: {application.jobLocation}</div>
    <div className="text-gray-500 text-xs">Candidate: {application.cityState}</div>
  </div>
</TableCell>
```

This would clearly distinguish between:
- **Job Location**: Where the position is located
- **Candidate Location**: Where the applicant is located

The submissions page now uses clearer terminology and works correctly with your current database schema.
